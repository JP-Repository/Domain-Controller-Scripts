# Automated Windows Server Backup & Notification Scripts

# Overview

This solution includes two PowerShell scripts that work together to automate Windows Server Backup and notify administrators upon successful completion.

# Script Details

1. Automated-WindowsBackup.ps1

Purpose: Performs a full system backup using wbadmin and enforces a retention policy by deleting old backups.

# Backup Target: Remote UNC path (e.g., \\ServerName\Backups).

Retention: Deletes backups older than a specified number of days (default: 2 days).

Logging: Backup operation output is logged to BackupLog.txt.

2. Monitor-WindowsBackup.ps1

Purpose: Monitors for successful completion of Windows Server Backup by checking for Event ID 4.

Notification: Sends an email to the specified recipient with backup status and the list of available backup folders.

SMTP: Requires access to a configured SMTP server for email delivery.

# Prerequisites

- The backup target directory is accessible and write-permitted.
- Scripts are run with administrative privileges.
- SMTP server is reachable from the host.
